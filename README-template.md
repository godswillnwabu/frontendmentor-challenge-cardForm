## Overview

I made this form project to understand more about form authentications; it was a little bit complicated but was actually fun at the end. I learnt alot.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)

### My challenges
* I had some couple of styling issues but i got them fixed as i played along with them.
* Getting the Card details and replacing them with the form inputs got me confusing after showing a undefined value; so i went on to study more about HTML DOM which helped me to complete my task.
